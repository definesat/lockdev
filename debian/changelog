liblockdev (0.9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * cleaned symlinks in docs dirs.
  * changed libs symlinks from /usr/lib to /lib
  * stripped main shared library.
  * Corrected wrong shlibs dependency (thanx to Hamish Moffatt, 
    closes: #22282).
  * Changed dependency of -dev from libc6 to libc6-dev, 
    thanx to James Troup (closes: #16476).
  * Added -I.. in Makefile.PL to allow compilation of the perl part even
    when the -dev package isn't installed (thanx to Martin Schulze for
    the patch) closes: #15834

liblockdev (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated manpage (degugging section).
  * added environment variable to set debug value, and signals 
    to change those values at runtime (if compiled with -DDEBUG).
  * avoided symlink to /usr/src changing .stab in asm source 
    file (overwritten implicit rule to produce asm source).
    Thanx to Martin Schulze <joey> for the help.
  * changed dbg package to install shared debug lib in 
    /usr/lib/debug and profile lib in /usr/lib/profile.
  * splitted debian/rules in included debian/policy
  * cleaned Makefile and changed to build debug shared lib.
    Thanx to Yann Dirson.
  * added change in umask value to allow full permissions to lock 
    files.  (this is questionable: would it be better to add a 
    suid program to check and remove dangling locks?)

liblockdev (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * cleaned Makefile and debian/rules
  * change in Makefile.PL to allow pristine compilation on new systems
    (closes: #15834, thanx to Martin Schulze).
  * added -dbg package with debug and profile libs.
  * problem with lenght of dev_t in glibc for printf: cast needed :-)
  * corrected ftp address in copyright file.

liblockdev (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * added symlink to dirs in /usr/doc (one dir for all packages),
     now /usr/doc/liblockdev is a symlink installed by -dev package,
     as the liblockdev.a and liblockdev.so symlinks.
     Instead, lblockdev-perl installs a copy of the docs because
     it doesn't depend on the run-time binary package (as -dev does).
  * cleaned spreading in the distribution: 
     source and run-time to section 'libs', development into 'devel',
     perl module into 'interpreters' (waiting for a perl section).
  * created extension perl library LockDev:: with manpage LockDev(3pm)
     and packaged as liblockdev0-perl.
  * moved symlink so.0 -> so.0.6 to runtime package.
  * added unlink of semaphore file (not really needed, just to clean up)
  * corrected error in Synopsis of manpage (oops).
  * cleaned source code: changed ANSI-C definition of functions to K&R,
     as recommended in GNU coding style (but not for indentation).
     Added ANSI-C prototypes for internal functions (exported one 
     already have them in .h interface file.
  * cleaned rules file, got rid of unneeded libc5 compatibility.
  * Moved back include of stdio.h from lockdev.h to .c (closes:Bug#14154)
     Thanx to Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org>
  * Corrected debian/rules to have binary-arch rule (closes:Bug#14062)

liblockdev (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * moved to libc6 (glibc2); added a "g" after soname in package name.
  * added rules to build also compatibility libc5 libs.

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Thu, 25 Sep 1997 11:51:22 +0300

liblockdev0 (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed priority from extra to optional.
  * cleaned Makefile and added separate static/debug library.
  * Cleaned include file.
  * Added global var liblockdev_debug for debugging level
  * Added 2 functions to set and reset debugging level (only in static lib)

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Sep 1997 02:20:01 +0300

liblockdev0 (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * avoided stripping of static lib (compiled with -DDEBUG)
  * added semaphore lock to avoid race condition in
    removing stale locks (thanx to Barak Pearlmutter)
  * changed unlink of stale lock to a complex and
    convoluted way to avoid conflicts between us and another
    process that doesn't use this library. Still exists the
    possibility of a conflict between two other processes that
    don't use this library, but we are safe.
  * cleaned code in lock_dev()

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Sep 1997 11:05:21 +0300

liblockdev0 (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed shared lib links.
