lockdev (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release.
  * debian/control:
    + Added myself as an uploader.  Thanks to Pawel Wiecek for granting
      me co-maintainership.
    + Build-Depend upon debhelper 4.
    + Update to Standards-Version 3.6.2.
  * debian/copyright:
    + Update FSF address.
    + Add myself as a contributor.
  * debian/compat: Use debhelper v4.
  * Remove all postinst and preinst templates; debhelper v4 generates
    ldconfig calls automatically.
  * Devices within subdirectories of /dev are locked properly, using
    ':' as a path delimiter in the device lock name.  For example,
    /dev/pts/2 is locked as /var/lock/LCK..pts:2
    (Closes: #115109, #135299).
  * Device major and minor numbers are computed using GNU libc
    builtins, rather than kernel headers (Closes: #331139).
  * src/sample.c debugging is amended to use the proper debugging
    functions (Closes: #331255).

lockdev (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Avoided repetute locking of the semaphore.
  * Corrected special case of semaphore misbehaviour (found while
    crosschecking between two instancies running under gdb).
  * Added modification on-the-fly of major number of device from 4 to 5
    in case it was referring to one of the 64 cua devices; it now locks
    the major+minor numbers of the corresponding ttyS device. The name
    remains unaffected, as it could be an arbitrary name.
    (Thanx to Daniel Quinlan <quinlan@transmeta.com>)
  * Tryed to use fcntl instead of flock, after suggestion of Daniel
    Quinlan, to permit use on NFS mounted partitions.
    I wasn't able to make it correctly work, so I conditioned the
    changes and left the code there, for further (future)
    investigations. Any help highly appreciated.
  * changed third file (LCK..<pid>) to have three dots, and made it stay
    there, as a quick reference. It doesn't hurt, and shouw the pid with
    a simple ls -l
  * Added full text of LGPL licence instead of GPL one added in the
    previous version (oops).

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Jun 1999 15:58:03 +0300

lockdev (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ttylock.h as Compatibility API to AIX. Programs written for
    that environment can be linked directly to lockdev library.
    (On AIX the symbols are in libc, so special care should be used)
  * changed location of manpages to /usr/share/man.
  * changed the name of the source to lockdev_0.10.tar.gz
  * changed address of FSF in Copyright file, added the full GPL text as
    LICENSE (only in the source), corrected name of the mailing list.
  * changed name of changelog, just to make lintian happier.
  * corrected name of docs dir for perl package.

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Apr 1999 21:04:53 +0300

liblockdev (0.9a) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Added more tests in postinst of liblockdev0g-dbg, to avoid strange
    problems encountered by Adam P. Harris (closes: #22565)

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Mon, 18 May 1998 15:21:12 +0300

liblockdev (0.9) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * cleaned symlinks in docs dirs.
  * changed libs symlinks from /usr/lib to /lib
  * stripped main shared library.
  * Corrected wrong shlibs dependency (thanx to Hamish Moffatt, 
    closes: #22282).
  * Changed dependency of -dev from libc6 to libc6-dev, 
    thanx to James Troup (closes: #16476).
  * Added -I.. in Makefile.PL to allow compilation of the perl part even
    when the -dev package isn't installed (thanx to Martin Schulze for
    the patch) closes: #15834

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Tue, 12 May 1998 13:39:27 +0300

liblockdev (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * updated manpage (degugging section).
  * added environment variable to set debug value, and signals 
    to change those values at runtime (if compiled with -DDEBUG).
  * avoided symlink to /usr/src changing .stab in asm source 
    file (overwritten implicit rule to produce asm source).
    Thanx to Martin Schulze <joey> for the help.
  * changed dbg package to install shared debug lib in 
    /usr/lib/debug and profile lib in /usr/lib/profile.
  * splitted debian/rules in included debian/policy
  * cleaned Makefile and changed to build debug shared lib.
    Thanx to Yann Dirson.
  * added change in umask value to allow full permissions to lock 
    files.  (this is questionable: would it be better to add a 
    suid program to check and remove dangling locks?)

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Tue, 23 Dec 1997 11:26:10 +0200

liblockdev (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * cleaned Makefile and debian/rules

  * corrected ftp address in copyright file.

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 01:00:50 +0200

liblockdev (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * added symlink to dirs in /usr/doc (one dir for all packages),
     now /usr/doc/liblockdev is a symlink installed by -dev package,
     as the liblockdev.a and liblockdev.so symlinks.
     Instead, lblockdev-perl installs a copy of the docs because
     it doesn't depend on the run-time binary package (as -dev does).
  * cleaned spreading in the distribution: 
     source and run-time to section 'libs', development into 'devel',
     perl module into 'interpreters' (waiting for a perl section).
  * created extension perl library LockDev:: with manpage LockDev(3pm)
     and packaged as liblockdev0-perl.
  * moved symlink so.0 -> so.0.6 to runtime package.
  * added unlink of semaphore file (not really needed, just to clean up)
  * corrected error in Synopsis of manpage (oops).
  * cleaned source code: changed ANSI-C definition of functions to K&R,
     as recommended in GNU coding style (but not for indentation).
     Added ANSI-C prototypes for internal functions (exported one 
     already have them in .h interface file.
  * cleaned rules file, got rid of unneeded libc5 compatibility.
  * Moved back include of stdio.h from lockdev.h to .c (closes:Bug#14154)
     Thanx to Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org>
  * Corrected debian/rules to have binary-arch rule (closes:Bug#14062)

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Oct 1997 13:45:34 +0300

  * Added 2 functions to set and reset debugging level (only in static lib)

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Sep 1997 02:20:01 +0300

liblockdev0 (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * avoided stripping of static lib (compiled with -DDEBUG)
  * added semaphore lock to avoid race condition in
    removing stale locks (thanx to Barak Pearlmutter)
  * changed unlink of stale lock to a complex and
    convoluted way to avoid conflicts between us and another
    process that doesn't use this library. Still exists the
    possibility of a conflict between two other processes that
    don't use this library, but we are safe.
  * cleaned code in lock_dev()

 -- Fabrizio Polacco <fpolacco@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Sep 1997 11:05:21 +0300
