2006-04-20  Paweł Więcek <coven@debian.org>

	* Version 1.0.3.

	* src/lockdev.c: Updated _dl_filename_1 to distinguish between
	  character and block devices. Lock file name changes thus from
	  LCK.012.345 to LCK.C.012.345.

2005-10-03  Roger Leigh  <rleigh@debian.org>

	* Version 1.0.2.

	* LockDev/Makefile.PL: Merge shobs support from the Debian diff.

	* Makefile Merge shobs support from the Debian diff.
	(tarball): Remove --exclude option which was broken with current
	versions of GNU tar.

	* src/sample.c (main): Use liblockdev_incr_debug when the "-d"
	option is used, to fix broken debugging support.

	* src/ttylock.h: Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.

	* src/lockdev.h: Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.

	* src/lockdev.c:
	(General) Replace the use of __linux__ with __GNU_LIBRARY__, and
	use the GNU libc gnu_dev_major() and gnu_dev_minor() functions
	rather than kernel macros.
	(General) Convert K&R C into ISO C89 C.
	(_dl_filename_1): Remove special casing for CUA devices on Linux
	systems; these devices have long been deprecated and are no longer
	available in current kernels.
	(_dl_filename_2): If a device name has '/' separators in its name,
	replace them with ':'s.  This is to support devices in
	subdirectories.
	(_dl_check_devname): If a device pathname starts with DEV_PATH,
	e.g. "/dev/", strip off only "/dev/", rather than the entire path.
	This is to support devices in subdirectories under /dev,
	e.g. DevFS, udev, devpts and LVM.

2001-05-27  Gergely Nagy  <algernon@debian.org>

	* Rules.mk: extracted from debian/policy

	* debian/rules: updated to new Debian Perl policy; move shared
	library from /lib to /usr/lib; properly strip binaries; include
	Section and Priority in the deb package

	* debian/policy: bumped standards-version, added min_perl_policy

	* debian/control: added build-depends, bumped standards-version,
	and a few cosmetic fixes

	* Makefile (perl-lib): Updated to new Debian Perl policy
	(tarball): do not include debian/

1999-12-01  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 1.0.0

	* added management of pseudo device /dev/tty , thanx to Alan Cox.

	* added unconditional malloc of supplied device argoment.

	* changed name of the shared lib to end in .so

	* changed Makefile.PL because the perl manpage disappeared.

	* Changed symbols in the API as suggested by Daniel Quinlan and
	Erik Troan. Changed soname accordingly.

	* Corrected manpages and added LSB proposal (draft 2).

	* corrected cua device management: use linux/major.h to determine
	the cua major number; conditioned to __linux__

	* Changed LICENSE file to hold the LGPL 2.1

1999-07-19  Raphael Hertzog  <rhertzog@hrnet.fr>

	* Version 0.11.1

	* NMU for the perl upgrade. Closes: #41522

	* Corrected the rules files to conform to perl policy 1.0.1.

	* Compiled with perl-5.005.

	* Corrected the location of the license.

	* Upgraded standards-version to 2.5.1

1999-06-02  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.11

	* Avoided repetute locking of the semaphore.

	* Corrected special case of semaphore misbehaviour (found while
	crosschecking between two instancies running under gdb).

	* Added modification on-the-fly of major number of device from 4
	to 5 in case it was referring to one of the 64 cua devices; it now
	locks the major+minor numbers of the corresponding ttyS
	device. The name remains unaffected, as it could be an arbitrary
	name.
	(Thanx to Daniel Quinlan <quinlan@transmeta.com>)

	* Tryed to use fcntl instead of flock, after suggestion of Daniel
	Quinlan, to permit use on NFS mounted partitions.  I wasn't able
	to make it correctly work, so I conditioned the changes and left
	the code there, for further (future) investigations. Any help
	highly appreciated.

	* changed third file (LCK..<pid>) to have three dots, and made it
	stay there, as a quick reference. It doesn't hurt, and shouw the
	pid with a simple ls -l

	* Added full text of LGPL licence instead of GPL one added in the
	previous version (oops).

1999-04-08  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.10

	* Added ttylock.h as Compatibility API to AIX. Programs written
	for that environment can be linked directly to lockdev library.
	(On AIX the symbols are in libc, so special care should be used)

	* changed location of manpages to /usr/share/man.

	* changed the name of the source to lockdev_0.10.tar.gz

	* changed address of FSF in Copyright file, added the full GPL
	text as LICENSE (only in the source), corrected name of the
	mailing list.

	* changed name of changelog, just to make lintian happier.

	* corrected name of docs dir for perl package.

1998-05-18  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.9a

	* Added more tests in postinst of liblockdev0g-dbg, to avoid
	strange problems encountered by Adam P. Harris (closes: #22565)

1998-05-12  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.9

	* cleaned symlinks in docs dirs.

	* changed libs symlinks from /usr/lib to /lib

	* stripped main shared library.

	* Corrected wrong shlibs dependency (thanx to Hamish Moffatt,
	closes: #22282).

	* Changed dependency of -dev from libc6 to libc6-dev, thanx to
	James Troup (closes: #16476).

	* Added -I.. in Makefile.PL to allow compilation of the perl part
	even when the -dev package isn't installed (thanx to Martin
	Schulze for the patch) closes: #15834

1997-12-23  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.8

	* updated manpage (degugging section).

	* added environment variable to set debug value, and signals to
	change those values at runtime (if compiled with -DDEBUG).

	* avoided symlink to /usr/src changing .stab in asm source
	file (overwritten implicit rule to produce asm source).  Thanx to
	Martin Schulze <joey> for the help.

	* changed dbg package to install shared debug lib in
	/usr/lib/debug and profile lib in /usr/lib/profile.

	* splitted debian/rules in included debian/policy

	* cleaned Makefile and changed to build debug shared lib.  Thanx
	to Yann Dirson.

	* added change in umask value to allow full permissions to lock
	files.  (this is questionable: would it be better to add a suid
	program to check and remove dangling locks?)

1997-11-30  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.7

	* cleaned Makefile and debian/rules

	* change in Makefile.PL to allow pristine compilation on new
	systems
	(closes: #15834, thanx to Martin Schulze).

	* added -dbg package with debug and profile libs.

	* problem with lenght of dev_t in glibc for printf: cast needed
	:-)

	* corrected ftp address in copyright file.

1997-10-22  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.6

	* added symlink to dirs in /usr/doc (one dir for all packages),
	now /usr/doc/liblockdev is a symlink installed by -dev package, as
	the liblockdev.a and liblockdev.so symlinks.  Instead,
	lblockdev-perl installs a copy of the docs because it doesn't
	depend on the run-time binary package (as -dev does).

	* cleaned spreading in the distribution: source and run-time to
	section 'libs', development into 'devel', perl module into
	'interpreters' (waiting for a perl section).

	* created extension perl library LockDev:: with manpage
	LockDev(3pm) and packaged as liblockdev0-perl.

	* moved symlink so.0 -> so.0.6 to runtime package.

	* added unlink of semaphore file (not really needed, just to clean
	up)

	* corrected error in Synopsis of manpage (oops).

	* cleaned source code: changed ANSI-C definition of functions to
	K&R, as recommended in GNU coding style (but not for indentation).
	Added ANSI-C prototypes for internal functions (exported one
	already have them in .h interface file.

	* cleaned rules file, got rid of unneeded libc5 compatibility.

	* Moved back include of stdio.h from lockdev.h to
	.c (closes:Bug#14154) Thanx to Juan Cespedes <cespedes@debian.org>

	* Corrected debian/rules to have binary-arch
	rule (closes:Bug#14062)

1997-09-25  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.5

	* moved to libc6 (glibc2); added a "g" after soname in package
	name.

	* added rules to build also compatibility libc5 libs.

1997-09-06  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.4

	* cleaned Makefile and added separate static/debug library.

	* Cleaned include file.

	* Added global var liblockdev_debug for debugging level

	* Added 2 functions to set and reset debugging level (only in
	static lib)

1997-09-05  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.3

	* avoided stripping of static lib (compiled with -DDEBUG)

	* added semaphore lock to avoid race condition in removing stale
	locks (thanx to Barak Pearlmutter)

	* changed unlink of stale lock to a complex and convoluted way to
	avoid conflicts between us and another process that doesn't use
	this library. Still exists the possibility of a conflict between
	two other processes that don't use this library, but we are safe.

	* cleaned code in lock_dev()

1997-09-04  Fabrizio Polacco  <fpolacco@debian.org>

	* Version 0.2
